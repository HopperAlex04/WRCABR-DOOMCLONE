*Converted projectiles from Doom image format to PNG. (They remain in Doom palette.)
*Converted monster sprites from truecolor PNG to paletted PNG.
*Frames I1, I2I8, and I3I7 were in Doom image format and Doom palette instead of PNG, and were lower detail than the other sprites; I recreated them using custom paletted PNGs.
*Converted WAV and Doom format sounds to OGG. (One FLAC format sound is unchanged.)
*Added Korax's step sound from Hexen (which the monster linked to but did not originally include).
*Replaced NULL with TNT1 in DECORATE.  Deleted NULL sprite.
*Added decals to "Lavaball", "Firebeam", and "DemonMeteor" projectiles.
*Added INFO and CREDITS lumps.
